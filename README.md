## About

This repository is a collection of my C language projects, exercises, and experiments. It includes simple programs for beginners as well as more complex applications for advanced learners. The main goal is to provide a resource for learning and improving C programming skills.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need a C compiler. If you don't have one installed, here are a few options:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** Available on most Unix-like systems. Install using your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install gcc`.
- **Clang:** Another great compiler available on Unix-like systems. Install using your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install clang`.
- **MinGW:** For Windows users. Download from the [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org/).

Once you have a compiler set up, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-language-codes.git
cd c-language-codes
